# LSD
A general purpose operating system kernel that is currently in development
To build and run you'll need to have cargo, as well as qemu, xorriso, and git
When all of that is installed, just run ``cargo run`` in the directory of the operating system, make sure you also have x86_64-unknown-none in rustup
